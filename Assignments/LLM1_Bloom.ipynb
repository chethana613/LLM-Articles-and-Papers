        "2. Bloom-Z models generate stories that make more sense. Their sentences flow together better, like a coherent book and fewer grammatical errors while Bloom models might sometimes jump around a bit.\n",
        "3. Bloom-Z models use fancier words and have a bigger pool of words to choose from. So, the generated stories sound more varied compared to Bloom models, which might sound a bit simpler.\n",

        "✅ Variations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Introducing repetition penalty did help mitigate the issue of repetitive sequences in the generated text across all models. But i found that the repetition_penality value higher than 1 didn't really impact on the diversity/randomness of the generated text. Eg: in bloom 1b7 and bloomz 1b7 models, The text generated with repetition penalty 2 is found same as the text generated with repetition penalty 1.5\n",

        "**Perplexity measures** how well a language model predicts the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity means the model is better at predicting, while higher perplexity suggests it struggles more.\n",

However, while scanning the generated text, there were some repetition words but I found that their context is different or the case sensitive. For Eg: In the test generated by bloomz-1b7-with penalty-1.5, the token 'one ' is present as well as the tokens 'someone','anyone','One'. It means that permutations of words are considered differently.\n",

This means that as the model size increases, the TTR tends to increase, and perplexity tends to decrease. The correlation between model size and TTR is not linear, but it shows a general trend of improvement as the model size increases. Similarly, the correlation between model size and perplexity is negative, indicating that larger models tend to perform better in terms of predicting the next token in a sequence, resulting in lower perplexity values.\n",

Water was pumped into the reservoirs without any human intervention. During droughts, the reservoirs were filled with water, but this was not always the case. This is called a reservoir failure. The reservoirs may also fail to meet the demands of the current drought. The reservoir failure may occur because of a fault in the reservoir itself. The reservoirs may also fail to meet the future needs of the reservoir under the same conditions. Such reservoir failure should be investigated. The reservoir failure should be investigated and evaluated by the authority. The authority should undertake the following actions: a. Determine whether a reservoir failure is a fault. b. Take action to prevent the reservoir failure from occurring. c. Determine if the reservoir failure will occur again. d. Determine if there is a chance of a recurrence\n",

Then dreams began falling apart .  I am still trying though , but now my goal is just not being so obsessed with having real life goals and instead focusing on making sure people can have fun while they are here for us before we go home from school or work again.  Nowadays if you see me at any point i will say I'm pretty tired as well... But then there 's no shame about wanting things like these : A good laugh , smiling faces ...
